I have always tried to keep my mind ready and open for new data.
I really like to combine science with technology & programming.
I am sure that the combination of these two things will be interesting and efficient! -__-
I have mastered Kali Linux to some extent and I am interested in programming in the field of hacking and security.
I am also interested in building and teaching artificial intelligence. Related to science and security. Exactly like my project!
